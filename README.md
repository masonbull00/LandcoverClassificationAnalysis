# LandcoverClassificationAnalysis
These are the R scripts that analyze landcover change from a prior classification. 
You should already have performed a landcover classification before running these scripts. 
See the Google Earth Engine Landcover classification repository for a landcover classification scheme.
These scripts are labeled 1-6 in the order they should be run. 
Libraries is initialized at the beginning of each script to get libraries all set up.
